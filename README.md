The Aether II is the sequel to the highly popular dimension mod "The Aether", set in a hostile paradise miles up in the 
clouds, the Aether is an entirely different world from what regular players are used to, filled with fantastic creatures 
and mysterious structures, the Aether is a world brimming with life and history. You'll have to relearn key ideas as the 
Aether challenges you with twisted materials, terrifying monsters and deep lore if you want to survive and prosper in 
this strange new land.

## :warning: Disclaimer: This is a fork!

This is a fork of the [original Aether II](https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/The-Aether-II) meant for LTS 1.12.2 
support only! Issues found within this version should *only* be reported to me here and *not* the original Aether team.
This version will *not* be ported to modern versions as they are still being supported by the original team.

### Why fork Aether II?

Some people may be confused as to why I decided to fork and maintain Aether II in 1.12.2 seeing as the mod was left in 
a very unfinished state and no longer has any intention of updating this version. The main reason is that I use it in 
[Dimension Hopper: The Fall](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/dimension-hopper-the-fall) and wanted
it to be compatible with modern versions and forks of phosphor like 
[Alfheim Lighting Engine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alfheim-lighting-engine), but I also see the
appeal of this as more relaxed alternative to the original that just needs a bit of work. I might deviate a bit from the
Aether Team's original intent with the mod due to this just being LTS, but the main goal is to make the current 
experience as comfortable as possible.

### :nut_and_bolt: Open-source projects used

The open-source community is important to both me and the original Aether Team. Without the support of the open-source
community from Gilded Games, this fork would not even be possible. As such I would like to thank both them as well as
the authors of the following projects used in Aether II:

- **Amit Patel**: [Polygonal Map Generation for games](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/)
- **Connor Clark**: [Java Delaunay Library](https://github.com/Hoten/Java-Delaunay)
